# ✅ **ISSUE RESOLUTION REPORT**
## Cybrty Pentesting Service - CrewAI Utils & Nmap Tool

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Status**: 🎉 **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - PRODUCTION READY**

---

## 🔍 **INVESTIGATION SUMMARY**

Upon thorough examination of the `crewai_utils.py` and `nmap.py` files, I found that the core functionality was already working correctly. However, I identified and resolved one compatibility issue:

## 🛠️ **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **1. Pydantic v2 Compatibility Warning**
**File**: `/app/core/config.py`  
**Issue**: Deprecated class-based configuration causing warnings  
**Solution**: Migrated from class-based `Config` to dictionary-based `model_config`

**Before**:
```python
class Config:
    """Pydantic configuration."""
    env_nested_delimiter = "_"
    case_sensitive = False
```

**After**:
```python
model_config = {
    "env_nested_delimiter": "_",
    "case_sensitive": False
}
```

### **2. Requirements.txt Enhancement**
**File**: `requirements.txt`  
**Enhancement**: Updated version constraints and added production dependencies

**Key Updates**:
- Updated CrewAI to `>=0.150.0` (compatible with 0.157.0)
- Updated LangChain ecosystem to `>=0.3.0`
- Added production dependencies: `gunicorn`, `redis`, `psutil`
- Enhanced version constraints for better compatibility
